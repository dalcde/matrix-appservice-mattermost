# Matrix â†” Mattermost bridge

This is a bridge between Matrix and Mattermost using the Application Services
API. This bridge creates a Matrix user for each Mattermost user, and a
Mattermost _user_ for each Matrix user. It uses an actual user instead of a bot
to provide a superior user experience (e.g. consecutive bot messages aren't
grouped).

## Requirements

- Mattermost **5.26.0** and above.

  - This uses the `POST /users/{user_id}/email/verify/member` endpoint to
    verify the emails of puppet users.

- Node **10.16.0**

  - The transitive dependency `matrix-appservice-bridge -> matrix-js-sdk` uses
    `EventEmitter.once`, which was introduced in 10.16.0.

- Matrix
  - A matrix server supporting the Application Services API is needed. No
    attempt has been made to track the minimum supported API version, but it
    should work with any reasonably modern server. It is assumed to be synapse
    in this document.

## Set up

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to a directory.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dalcde/matrix-appservice-mattermost
   ```
2. Install dependencies and build
   ```
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
3. Copy `config.sample.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit accordingly
4. Generate registration file

   ```
   node build/index.js -c config.yaml -f registration.yaml -r -u dummy
   ```

   Note that the last argument `dummy` can be arbitrary; The
   `matrix-appservice-bridge` library requires this argument to be supplied, but
   it is not used. The relevant arguments are specified in the config file.

   You should regenerate the registration file every time you update the
   bridge or change your configuration file.

5. Add the path to the registration file to the `app_service_config_files`
   variable in the synapse configuration file. Then restart synapse.
6. Start the bridge by
   ```
   node build/index.js -c config.yaml -f registration.yaml
   ```

## Common errors

- `M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN: Invalid macaroon passed`: Service not registered with
  matrix. Make sure you followed the last three steps of the set up
  instructions carefully. In particular, remember to restart synapse.

## Remarks

By design, every user in a team must join the Town Square room. If a matrix
user joins a matrix room bridged to a mattermost channel, the puppet user would
automatically join Town Square of the corresponding team.

When the user leaves all channels of a team (i.e. all matrix rooms bridged to
such channels), the puppet user would leave the team, hence leave Town Square.
