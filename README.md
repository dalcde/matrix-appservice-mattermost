# Matrix â†” Mattermost bridge

This is a bridge between Matrix and Mattermost using the Application Services
API. This bridge creates a Matrix user for each Mattermost user, and a
Mattermost _user_ for each Matrix user. It uses an actual user instead of a bot
to provide a superior user experience (e.g. consecutive bot messages aren't
grouped).

This is currently in beta, but is sufficiently usable that it is used in a
production system (with understanding users) by the author.

## Requirements

- Mattermost **5.26.0** and above.

  - This uses the `POST /users/{user_id}/email/verify/member` endpoint to
    verify the emails of puppet users.

- Node **10.16.0**

  - The dependency `matrix-js-sdk` uses `EventEmitter.once`, which was
    introduced in 10.16.0.

- Matrix
  - A matrix server supporting the Application Services API is needed. No
    attempt has been made to track the minimum supported API version, but it
    should work with any reasonably modern server. It is assumed to be synapse
    in this document.

## Set up

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to a directory.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dalcde/matrix-appservice-mattermost
   ```
2. Install dependencies and build
   ```
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
3. Copy `config.sample.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit accordingly
4. Generate registration file

   ```
   node build/index.js -c config.yaml -f registration.yaml -r
   ```

   You should regenerate the registration file every time you update the
   bridge or change your configuration file.

5. Add the path to the registration file to the `app_service_config_files`
   variable in the synapse configuration file. Then restart synapse.
6. Start the bridge by
   ```
   node build/index.js -c config.yaml -f registration.yaml
   ```

### Packaging and distribution

After building, only the contents of `build/` are needed for the bridge to run.
Of course, the dependencies are also needed. ONe can use system dependencies,
or one can vendor the dependencies by moving the `node_modules` folder into
`build/` after `npm ci --proudction`. All runtime dependencies are portable and
do not require platform-specific building.

### sd_notify

The bridge attempts to notify `systemd` when it has initialized.
This ensures `systemctl start matrix-appservice-mattermost` will not return
until the bridge is initialized. To configure this, add the following lines to
the `Service` section of the systemd service file:

```
Type=notify
NotifyAccess=all
```

The second line is necessary since we spawn `systemd-notify` to perform the
notification; node doesn't natively support this.

_Note:_ The bridge is considered initialized when all mattermost and matrix
messages in the bridged channels from that point on will be received by the
bridge (barring, e.g. connection issues). Specifically, the bridge is
considered initialized after the mattermost websocket is connected and the
bridge has joined all channels to be bridged.

## Common errors

- `M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN: Invalid macaroon passed`: Service not registered with
  matrix. Make sure you followed the last three steps of the set up
  instructions carefully. In particular, remember to restart synapse.

## Admin endpoint

There is an admin endpoint that lets users interact with the bridge. This is
accessed in the same way as the appservice.

### Status endpoint

```
GET /bridge/status
```

The possible replies are

- `initializing` - The bridge is initializing
- `running` - The bridge is running

Of course, if the request is made too early in the initialization stage, there
would be no response at all.

### Rename endpoint

```
POST /bridge/rename/:oldName/:newName?access_token=<hs_token>
```

This renames the mattermost puppet with username `:oldName` to `:newName`. The
`hs_token` is the token specified in the registration file.

## Remarks

### Town Square

By design, every user in a team must join the Town Square room. If a matrix
user joins a matrix room bridged to a mattermost channel, the puppet user would
automatically join Town Square of the corresponding team.

When the user leaves all channels of a team (i.e. all matrix rooms bridged to
such channels), the puppet user would leave the team, hence leave Town Square.

### Post deletion

Mattermost and matrix "group" posts in different ways. For example, when
deleting the root post of a thread in Mattermost, the entire thread is deleted.
Similarly, attachments in Mattermost are part of a text message, whereas in
Matrix they are separate events.

Our implementation is based on the following two principles:

1.  From the point of view of a single platform, the presence of a bridge
    should not affect what happens when a post is deleted.

2.  When a post is deleted on a platform, the contents must not be visible on
    the other platform.

In practice, this means if we delete a message on Matrix, there might be more
posts deleted on Mattermost. These Mattermost deletions will not be reflected
on the matrix side, so there will be more messages on Matrix than on
Mattermost.

Also, Mattermost does not remember who performed the deletion. Thus, on the
matrix side, it is always displayed as the bot user deleting the message.
